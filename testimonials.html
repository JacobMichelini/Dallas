Also, not knowing how to deal with the process, he handled it with courtesy and thoughtfulness. He gave me time to sort out my affairs without the feeling of being forced. Several people saw my house and Danny offered me more money for my house, and without any hassles. The closing went off without a hitch because Danny and his closer bent over backwards to the get the house sold.<h9>"</h9>
